# UnrealSharpMemory (COMING SOON)
 UnrealSharpMemory is a user friendly helper framework to create extra sensory perception, radar, and other tools and game mods for UnrealEngine games.

# What is this?
 Unreal Sharp is written in C#, and works by using Memory.dll for Write/Read.
 
# How does this work
 This project heavily relies on Unreal Engine's reflection system, using strings to dump out game info.
